Suite of test files used by the validator.

- dwca-occurrence.zip : Structurally valid  Dwc-A
- dwca-occurrence-broken.zip : Dwc-A where the meta.xml file is broken (invalid xml)
- dwca-occurrence-schema.zip : Dwc-A where the meta.xml file doesn't validate against it's XSD schema

We keep the unzipped version to simply testing.
